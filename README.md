# Stock Market Network Analysis

### Stock market connections

This project utilizes network theory to analyze complex interactions within the stock market. The *MATLAB* script **Network.m** is central to this analysis. It employs advanced graph theory techniques to construct and analyze a network graph of the stock market. This includes calculating node centrality to identify the most influential stocks, and community detection algorithms to uncover clusters of stocks that move similarly. The *Python* script **Get_data.py** supports this analysis by extracting up-to-date ticker and stock data from various financial databases, ensuring that the input data is comprehensive and current. Together, these tools allow for a detailed exploration of market dynamics, offering insights that can inform better investment strategies and market predictions.

### Top-stock Index

Additionally, this project studied stock market connections, focusing on how top stocks interact and influence each other, using specific stock indices and tickers for detailed insights. The main tool here is a MATLAB file, degree.m, which calculates the connectivity levels of these stocks, identifying key players and their links. provides valuable insights into stock market dynamics, helping to guide strategic investment decisions.
